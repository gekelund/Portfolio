        I am an ambitious individual with great passion for solving problems. I
        am currently studying at KYH to become a front end developer with focus
        on javascript, React, HTML, CSS, node but also to work after the agile
        processeses. I have a background in management and engineering where a
        have a management degree from Martin College, Sydney Australia and a
        Bachelor's degree in Biomechanical engineering from HÃ¶gskolan i
        Halmstad.{" "}

        I got really interested in coding last year (2019) when my girlfriend
        who is currently working as a front end developer introduced me to it. I
        immediately loved the problem solving aspect of it and the logic behind
        it. So I decided then and there that this is what I want to do for the
        rest of my career. My previous experience in both management and
        engineering enabling me to effectively communicate with wide range of
        people and understand the technical aspects.

        My passion every since I was a child is history. In my early twenties I
        decided that I wanted to visit some of the places I heard and read about
        as a child. So me and a friend of my traveling both to Asia and South
        America to experience the culture and history.
